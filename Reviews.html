      <h2>What Our Players Say</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Ranked up faster than I expected!”</strong>
          <p>The coaching sessions were clear and practical. My coach helped me fix my positioning in Valorant, and I went from Silver to Platinum in just a few weeks.</p>
          <p><em>— Amir, Valorant Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Flexible schedule and great feedback.”</strong>
          <p>I work odd hours, but the coach adjusted to my availability. The replay reviews were detailed and easy to apply in my next games.</p>
          <p><em>— Sarah, Mobile Legends Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Not just mechanics — mindset too.”</strong>
          <p>I learned how to stay calm under pressure and make smarter rotations. It’s more than just gameplay tips — it’s a full improvement plan.</p>
          <p><em>— Daniel, Valorant & MLBB</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Worth every cent.”</strong>
          <p>The seasonal discount made it affordable, and the results speak for themselves. I’ll definitely book again next season.</p>
          <p><em>— Aisha, Mobile Legends Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Finally broke out of Gold!”</strong>
          <p>I was stuck in Gold for months. After two weeks of coaching, I learned how to control my spray and use utility properly. Now I’m climbing steadily.</p>
          <p><em>— Jason, Valorant Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Clear explanations, no fluff.”</strong>
          <p>The coach didn’t just tell me what I did wrong — he explained why it mattered and how to fix it. Every session felt productive.</p>
          <p><em>— Maya, Mobile Legends Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Teamwork improved instantly.”</strong>
          <p>I used to solo‑queue and tilt easily. With coaching, I learned how to communicate better and lead my team. It’s made ranked so much more enjoyable.</p>
          <p><em>— Arif, Valorant Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Affordable and effective.”</strong>
          <p>I was worried coaching would be too expensive, but the seasonal promo made it accessible. Honestly, the value I got was way more than I expected.</p>
          <p><em>— Nadia, Mobile Legends Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Replay reviews were a game‑changer.”</strong>
          <p>Watching my own mistakes with a coach pointing them out was eye‑opening. I never realized how many small habits were holding me back.</p>
          <p><em>— Ken, Valorant Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Patience and positivity.”</strong>
          <p>Even when I messed up, the coach stayed patient and encouraging. That made me more confident to try new strategies without fear of failing.</p>
          <p><em>— Lina, Mobile Legends Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Ranked up with friends too.”</strong>
          <p>I booked a duo coaching session with my friend. We both improved our synergy and climbed together. It was fun and effective.</p>
          <p><em>— Hafiz & Amir, Valorant Duo</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Flexible scheduling helped a lot.”</strong>
          <p>I work late shifts, but the coach adjusted to my availability. It’s rare to find that kind of flexibility in online services.</p>
          <p><em>— Siti, Mobile Legends Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Not just mechanics — strategy too.”</strong>
          <p>I thought coaching would only be about aim drills, but I learned rotations, economy management, and even mindset tricks. It’s the full package.</p>
          <p><em>— Daniel, Valorant Player</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <strong>“Felt like a pro team experience.”</strong>
          <p>The structure of the sessions reminded me of how pro teams train — warm‑ups, reviews, and clear goals. It made me take my own improvement more seriously.</p>
